    "description0": "NVA is a service for collecting and making available information about, and results from, Norwegian research. The institution (the data controller) registers and maintains its own content in the service and configures distribution rules for published resources (articles, reports, data sets, etc.). The service also imports material affiliated to the institution from other data sources. NVA makes the institution's open material available via open interfaces for the purpose of making the content known and searchable for the public and promoting indexing in search engines and portals.",
    "description1": "NVA supports postponed publication of resources. This means that the registration can be completed so that metadata about the resource is published, while the resource will not be openly available until the specified date.",
